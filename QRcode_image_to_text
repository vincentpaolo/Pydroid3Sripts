"""
This code decodes QR codes in an image using OpenCV (cv2).

What this code does:
1. Reads an image where QR codes may be present.
2. Converts the image to grayscale for processing.
3. Detects QR codes in the image.
4. Decodes the content of the detected QR codes.
5. Prints the content of the decoded QR codes.

What you need to modify:
- Ensure OpenCV is installed: 'pip install opencv-python'.
- Provide the correct location of the image in the variable 'image_path'.
- Ensure the image contains a valid QR code.

Notes:
- If multiple QR codes are detected, the contents of all QR codes are printed separately.
- If no QR code is detected, an appropriate message is printed.
